# LibJS
LibJS is a little framework for javascript designed to simplify and elavate the functionality of your code to a new level.
LibJs is still in a very early stage of development so you might encounter some bugs. 
It is completly free to use. Happy coding :)

How to setup:
1. Download the framework and place it in your project's directory
2. In your javascript file use "import * as libJs from './Lib.js'"
3. Create a canvas using the createCanvas() function which takes a width and a height
4. Create a draw loop by creating a function and using requestAnimationFrame(draw) inside of it and call it.
5. To draw first change the background color using backgroundColor() function then call the coresponding function in the draw loop
6. And you are done!
